    High-level tests for using ``asyncio``-based code inside greenlets.

    For this functionality to be useful, users need to be able to use 3rd party
    libraries that use sockets etc..  Merely hooking up futures to greenlets
    doesn't help if you can't use the asyncio library ecosystem.  So this set
    of tests does more integration-y tests showing that functionality works.
