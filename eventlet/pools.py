class Pool(object):
    """
    Pool class implements resource limitation and construction.

    There are two ways of using Pool: passing a `create` argument or
    subclassing. In either case you must provide a way to create
    the resource.

    When using `create` argument, pass a function with no arguments::

        http_pool = pools.Pool(create=httplib2.Http)

    If you need to pass arguments, build a nullary function with either
    `lambda` expression::

        http_pool = pools.Pool(create=lambda: httplib2.Http(timeout=90))

    or :func:`functools.partial`::

        from functools import partial
        http_pool = pools.Pool(create=partial(httplib2.Http, timeout=90))

    When subclassing, define only the :meth:`create` method
    to implement the desired resource::

        class MyPool(pools.Pool):
            def create(self):
                return MyObject()

    If using 2.5 or greater, the :meth:`item` method acts as a context manager;
    that's the best way to use it::

        with mypool.item() as thing:
            thing.dostuff()

    The maximum size of the pool can be modified at runtime via
    the :meth:`resize` method.

    Specifying a non-zero *min-size* argument pre-populates the pool with
    *min_size* items.  *max-size* sets a hard limit to the size of the pool --
    it cannot contain any more items than *max_size*, and if there are already
    *max_size* items 'checked out' of the pool, the pool will cause any
    greenthread calling :meth:`get` to cooperatively yield until an item
    is :meth:`put` in.

        giving each item approximately equal utilization.  If ``True``, the
