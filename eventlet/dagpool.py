class DAGPool(object):
    """
    A DAGPool is a pool that constrains greenthreads, not by max concurrency,
    but by data dependencies.

    This is a way to implement general DAG dependencies. A simple dependency
    tree (flowing in either direction) can straightforwardly be implemented
    using recursion and (e.g.)
    :meth:`GreenThread.imap() <eventlet.greenthread.GreenThread.imap>`.
    What gets complicated is when a given node depends on several other nodes
    as well as contributing to several other nodes.

    With DAGPool, you concurrently launch all applicable greenthreads; each
    will proceed as soon as it has all required inputs. The DAG is implicit in
    which items are required by each greenthread.

    Each greenthread is launched in a DAGPool with a key: any value that can
    serve as a Python dict key. The caller also specifies an iterable of other
    keys on which this greenthread depends. This iterable may be empty.

    The greenthread callable must accept (key, results), where:

    key
        is its own key

    results
        is an iterable of (key, value) pairs.

    A newly-launched DAGPool greenthread is entered immediately, and can
    perform any necessary setup work. At some point it will iterate over the
    (key, value) pairs from the passed 'results' iterable. Doing so blocks the
    greenthread until a value is available for each of the keys specified in
    its initial dependencies iterable. These (key, value) pairs are delivered
    in chronological order, *not* the order in which they are initially
    specified: each value will be delivered as soon as it becomes available.

    The value returned by a DAGPool greenthread becomes the value for its
    key, which unblocks any other greenthreads waiting on that key.

    If a DAGPool greenthread terminates with an exception instead of returning
    a value, attempting to retrieve the value raises :class:`PropagateError`,
    which binds the key of the original greenthread and the original
    exception. Unless the greenthread attempting to retrieve the value handles
    PropagateError, that exception will in turn be wrapped in a PropagateError
    of its own, and so forth. The code that ultimately handles PropagateError
    can follow the chain of PropagateError.exc attributes to discover the flow
    of that exception through the DAG of greenthreads.

    External greenthreads may also interact with a DAGPool. See :meth:`wait_each`,
    :meth:`waitall`, :meth:`post`.

    It is not recommended to constrain external DAGPool producer greenthreads
    in a :class:`GreenPool <eventlet.greenpool.GreenPool>`: it may be hard to
    provably avoid deadlock.

        :meth:`post` calls and from :meth:`spawn` calls: in other words, all
        the keys of which this DAGPool is aware.

        wait_each() is a generator producing (key, value) pairs as a value
        becomes available for each requested key. wait_each() blocks the
        calling greenthread until the next value becomes available. If the
        DAGPool was prepopulated with values for any of the relevant keys, of
        course those can be delivered immediately without waiting.

        Delivery order is intentionally decoupled from the initial sequence of
        keys: each value is delivered as soon as it becomes available. If
        multiple keys are available at the same time, wait_each() delivers
        each of the ready ones in arbitrary order before blocking again.

        The DAGPool does not distinguish between a value returned by one of
        its own greenthreads and one provided by a :meth:`post` call or *preload* data.

        The wait_each() generator terminates (raises StopIteration) when all
        specified keys have been delivered. Thus, typical usage might be:

        ::

                # process this ready key and value
            # continue processing now that we've gotten values for all keys

        By implication, if you pass wait_each() an empty iterable of keys, it
        returns immediately without yielding anything.

        If the value to be delivered is a :class:`PropagateError` exception object, the
        generator raises that PropagateError instead of yielding it.
