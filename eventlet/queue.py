"""Synchronized queues.

The :mod:`eventlet.queue` module implements multi-producer, multi-consumer
queues that work across greenlets, with the API similar to the classes found in
the standard :mod:`Queue` and :class:`multiprocessing <multiprocessing.Queue>`
modules.

A major difference is that queues in this module operate as channels when
initialized with *maxsize* of zero. In such case, both :meth:`Queue.empty`
and :meth:`Queue.full` return ``True`` and :meth:`Queue.put` always blocks until
a call to :meth:`Queue.get` retrieves the item.

An interesting difference, made possible because of greenthreads, is
that :meth:`Queue.qsize`, :meth:`Queue.empty`, and :meth:`Queue.full` *can* be
used as indicators of whether the subsequent :meth:`Queue.get`
or :meth:`Queue.put` will not block.  The new methods :meth:`Queue.getting`
and :meth:`Queue.putting` report on the number of greenthreads blocking
in :meth:`put <Queue.put>` or :meth:`get <Queue.get>` respectively.
