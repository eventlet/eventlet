        they're completed rather than the order the coroutines were launched.

        Iteration stops when we've yielded results for each arguments tuple in
        *iterable*. Unlike :meth:`wait_all` and :meth:`process_all`, this
        function does not wait for any previously-submitted :meth:`execute` or
        :meth:`execute_async` calls.

        Results are temporarily buffered in a queue. If you pass *qsize=*, this
        value is used to limit the max size of the queue: an attempt to buffer
        too many results will suspend the completed :class:`CoroutinePool`
        coroutine until the requesting coroutine (the caller of
        :meth:`generate_results`) has retrieved one or more results by calling
        this generator-iterator's ``next()``.

        If any coroutine raises an uncaught exception, that exception will
        propagate to the requesting coroutine via the corresponding ``next()``
        call.

        What I particularly want these tests to illustrate is that using this
        generator function::

            for result in generate_results(function, iterable):
                # ... do something with result ...
                pass

        executes coroutines at least as aggressively as the classic eventlet
        idiom::

            events = [pool.execute(function, *args) for args in iterable]
            for event in events:
                result = event.wait()
                # ... do something with result ...

        even without a distinct event object for every arg tuple in *iterable*,
        and despite the funny flow control from interleaving launches of new
        coroutines with yields of completed coroutines' results.

        (The use case that makes this function preferable to the classic idiom
        above is when the *iterable*, which may itself be a generator, produces
        millions of items.)

        >>> from eventlet import coros
        >>> import string
        >>> pool = coros.CoroutinePool(max_size=5)
        >>> pausers = [coros.Event() for x in xrange(2)]
        >>> def longtask(evt, desc):
        ...     print("%s woke up with %s" % (desc, evt.wait()))

        >>> def quicktask(desc):
        ...     print("returning %s" % desc)
        ...     return desc

        (Instead of using a ``for`` loop, step through :meth:`generate_results`
        items individually to illustrate timing)
